# EEG App for Android

This project is a BLE-based EEG sensor simulation for use with the SeizureGuard application. It is an Android app that mimics an EEG sensor by transmitting EEG-like data over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the SeizureGuard system.

## BLE Communication

- The app simulates an EEG sensor by advertising and transmitting EEG-like data over BLE.
- It can connect with compatible BLE receivers, such as the SeizureGuard system.

## License

This project follows the same licensing as the main **SeizureGuard** repository.
